# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Keep the text inside .intro-content in the same place, but have the
   background extend from one side of the viewport to the other, no matter how
   wide or narrow the browser is.

2. Limit the maximum width of the text in the bottom area. You may modify the
   HTML if needed (you probably should for this challenge)

**You may modify the HTML if needed**
